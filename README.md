## 🧪 SOHO Network Labs

- 🖨️ **[Secure SOHO Network Configuration Lab](secure-soho-network-lab/)**  
  This lab documents the architecture and configuration of a secure, segmented home network built using the ASUS RT-AX86U Pro router. It features IoT isolation, VPN Fusion split tunneling with NordVPN, firewall hardening, and centralized syslog logging via a Raspberry Pi 4.

- 🖨️ **[Printer Firewall Hardening](https://github.com/SecOpsPete/cybersecurity-tools/blob/main/printer-firewall-hardening/README.md)**  
  Step-by-step Windows Firewall rule configuration to prevent public access to printers while maintaining local and cloud printing capabilities.
  
- 🛡️ **[Secure Network Security Profile](https://secure-network-profile/blob/main/README.md)**  
  Assesses and documents the security posture of a small office/home office (SOHO) network. Highlights layered defenses including VLAN segmentation, BitLocker encryption, firewall rules, router hardening, and endpoint protections. Includes architectural diagram and syslog integration via Raspberry Pi.
