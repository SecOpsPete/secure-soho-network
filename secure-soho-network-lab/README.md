# 🛡️ Secure Home Lab Network for Cybersecurity Testing & Network Defense

This lab simulates a production-grade network environment within a home setting, designed for cybersecurity experimentation, monitoring, and resilience testing. It incorporates enterprise-style features such as VLAN segmentation, centralized logging via ELK, dual-ISP failover with Speedify, VPN split tunneling, and endpoint hardening. With layered defenses, proactive visibility, and purpose-built redundancy, this environment enables hands-on testing of SIEM pipelines, threat detection, and secure architecture principles in a controlled and realistic setting.

### 💻 Cybersecurity War Machine Specs:
* Intel Core i9-13900K (24c/32t, nearly 6GHz turbo)
* NVIDIA RTX 5070 (Blackwell, 12GB GDDR7)
* 64GB DDR5 @ 6000+ MHz
* Samsung 990 Pro 2TB + Lexar NM790 1TB (both NVMe)
* MSI PRO Z790-P WIFI (PCIe 5.0, DDR5 support)
* MSI MAG A850GL PSU (ATX 3.1, PCIe 5.1)

Key features include:

- **Network Segmentation:** Trusted, IoT, guest, and mobile devices are isolated to reduce lateral movement risk.
- **ISP Redundancy:** Dedicated cellular phone data bonded via Speedify acts as a secondary ISP link.
- **Manual Channel Optimization:** Wireless channels are strategically assigned for performance and device compatibility.
- **VPN Fusion:** Select devices route traffic through NordVPN while others use direct ISP or cellular access.
- **Firewall Hardening:** Unsolicited traffic is blocked at the router and endpoint level using UFW and secure defaults.
- **Centralized Logging:** A Raspberry Pi syslog server forwards logs to a Dockerized ELK stack for real-time visibility.
- **DNS Hardening:** DNSSEC validation and DNS-over-TLS encryption are enforced at the router to ensure authenticity and privacy of DNS lookups.
- **Power Protection:** A CyberPower UPS provides battery backup and voltage regulation for critical devices.
- **Scalability:** Modular logging, ECS compliance, and containerized services allow future SIEM integration and enterprise-grade monitoring.

This evolving lab serves as a realistic platform for testing endpoint defense, log analysis, and secure networking—all within a controlled home environment.

## 🔧 Router Configuration Summary

### ✔️ Wireless Settings

| Band | SSID | Security | Bandwidth | Features |
|------|------|----------|-----------|----------|
| 2.4GHz | SecOpsPete_Main | WPA2-Personal / AES | 20/40 MHz | Wi-Fi 6, PMF Capable, Agile Multiband |
| 5GHz | SecOpsPete_Main | WPA2-Personal / AES | 80 MHz | Wi-Fi 6, TWT, Agile Multiband |
| Guest (2.4GHz) | Old IoT SSID | WPA2-Personal / AES | 20 MHz | Intranet Access Disabled, Device Isolation Enabled |

> The ASUS ZenWiFi XT9 AX7800 is configured as a dedicated Access Point (AP), extending Wi-Fi coverage while maintaining a unified SSID structure and inheriting all security policies from the RT-AX86U Pro core router.

---

### 🌐 DNSSEC & Encrypted DNS Configuration

The RT-AX86U Pro router is hardened with **DNSSEC validation** and **DNS-over-TLS (DoT)** to protect DNS integrity and privacy across the home lab:

| Setting                        | Value                         |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **DNS Privacy Protocol**       | DNS-over-TLS (DoT)            |
| **Profile**                    | Strict (no fallback allowed)  |
| **Primary Resolver**           | Quad9 (`9.9.9.9`, `dns.quad9.net`) |
| **Secondary Resolver**         | Cloudflare (`1.1.1.1`, `cloudflare-dns.com`) |
| **Enable DNSSEC Support**      | ✅ Yes                        |
| **Validate Unsigned Replies**  | ✅ Yes (rejects bogus responses) |
| **Prevent Client Auto DoH**    | ✅ Yes (forces router-controlled DNS) |
| **DNS Rebind Protection**      | ✅ Enabled                    |

> This configuration ensures all DNS lookups are both **encrypted in transit** and **cryptographically validated** at the router level. Quad9 provides additional security filtering for malicious domains, while Cloudflare acts as a resilient fallback. Clients cannot bypass DNS policy using DoH, guaranteeing consistent enforcement across the network.

## 🧠 AiProtection (Trend Micro)

AiProtection is a built-in security suite powered by **Trend Micro**, integrated directly into the ASUS RT-AX86U Pro router. It provides proactive, router-level threat prevention for all devices on the network — especially useful for IoT and guest clients that may lack built-in defenses.

Unlike endpoint antivirus, AiProtection inspects traffic at the perimeter, offering continuous monitoring and automatic blocking of known threats.

| Module                    | Status      | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Malicious Site Blocking**    | ✅ Enabled   | Prevents access to known phishing domains and malicious URLs.               |
| **Two-Way IPS**                | ✅ Enabled   | Detects and blocks suspicious inbound and outbound traffic.                 |
| **Infected Device Quarantine**| ✅ Enabled   | Automatically isolates compromised devices to prevent lateral movement.     |
| **Router Security Scan**       | ✅ All green ✅ | Periodic scans confirm strong security posture and no risky configurations. |

> AiProtection provides an added layer of baseline security, complementing the network's segmented topology, firewall rules, and centralized log monitoring. While it doesn't replace host-based security tools, it strengthens the first line of defense at the network edge.

## 🔄 VPN Fusion – Split Tunneling

The ASUS RT-AX86U Pro supports **VPN Fusion**, which allows selected devices to use a VPN connection while others access the internet directly via the ISP (Starlink). This setup balances **privacy, speed, and functionality** based on each device's role.

### Device Routing Table

| Device                                | Route            |
|----------------------------------------|------------------|
| 🧠 Desktop / Laptop                    | 🔐 NordVPN       |
| 📱 iPhone                              | 🌐 Starlink WAN  |
| 📺 Smart TV                            | 🌐 Starlink WAN  |
| 🔌 IoT Devices (e.g. plugs, switches)  | 🌐 Starlink WAN  |
| 🖨️ Printer                             | 🌐 Starlink WAN  |
| 🐧 Raspberry Pi (Syslog Server)        | 🌐 Starlink WAN  |

> Devices with privacy or security requirements (like your main desktop) are routed through NordVPN, while bandwidth-sensitive or low-risk devices (like IoT, printers, and media streamers) use the direct Starlink connection.
