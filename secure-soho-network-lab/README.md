## 🛡️ Home Network Security Lab

This project documents a resilient and secure home network built for hands-on cybersecurity experimentation. It’s anchored by an **ASUS RT-AX86U Pro** router and an **ASUS ZenWiFi XT9** mesh node in Access Point (AP) mode, delivering high-performance coverage and stability.

Key features include:

- **Network Segmentation**: Trusted, IoT, and guest devices are isolated via SSIDs and VLAN-like logic to reduce lateral movement risk.
- **Manual Channel Optimization**: Wireless channels are strategically assigned for performance and device compatibility.
- **VPN Fusion**: Select devices route traffic through NordVPN while others use direct ISP access.
- **Firewall Hardening**: Unsolicited traffic is blocked at the router and endpoint level using UFW and secure defaults.
- **Centralized Logging**: A Raspberry Pi syslog server forwards logs to a Dockerized ELK stack for real-time visibility.
- **Power Protection**: A CyberPower UPS provides battery backup and voltage regulation for critical devices.
- **Scalability**: Modular logging, ECS compliance, and containerized services allow future SIEM integration and enterprise-grade monitoring.

This evolving lab serves as a realistic platform for testing endpoint defense, log analysis, and secure networking—all within a controlled home environment.

## 🔧 Router Configuration Summary

### ✔️ Wireless Settings

| Band | SSID | Security | Bandwidth | Features |
|------|------|----------|-----------|----------|
| 2.4GHz | SecOpsPete_Main | WPA2-Personal / AES | 20/40 MHz | Wi-Fi 6, PMF Capable, Agile Multiband |
| 5GHz | SecOpsPete_Main | WPA2-Personal / AES | 80 MHz | Wi-Fi 6, TWT, Agile Multiband |
| Guest (2.4GHz) | Old IoT SSID | WPA2-Personal / AES | 20 MHz | Intranet Access Disabled, Device Isolation Enabled |

> The ASUS ZenWiFi XT9 AX7800 is configured as a dedicated Access Point (AP), extending Wi-Fi coverage while maintaining a unified SSID structure and inheriting all security policies from the RT-AX86U Pro core router.

## 📌 Static IP Addressing Strategy

To maintain consistency, reduce DHCP churn, and simplify device identification in log files and firewall rules, key infrastructure devices are assigned **static IP addresses** through the router’s DHCP reservation table.

### 🎯 Why Static IPs?

Static IP assignments serve several important functions in a secure and segmented home lab:

- **Reliability**: Devices like the syslog server (Raspberry Pi) or VPN-routed desktops maintain the same address, ensuring uninterrupted forwarding, monitoring, and access.
- **Log Integrity**: Centralized logging systems benefit from stable IPs, making it easier to trace events and correlate activity in Kibana dashboards.
- **Firewall Control**: Granular UFW and router-level firewall rules depend on consistent IPs to restrict access (e.g., only allow Logstash ports from `192.168.50.3`).
- **DNS and Hostname Mapping**: Enables optional hostname assignments for clarity across logs and tools.
- **Reduced Conflict**: Prevents accidental DHCP assignment overlap or reassignment that could break scripts, SSH tunnels, or static routes.

### 🧭 Static IP Map

| Device         | MAC Address          | Static IP         | Hostname       |
|----------------|----------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| Peters_Desktop | `D8:43:AE:XX:XX:XX`   | `192.168.50.3`     | —              |
| HP Office Jet  | `80:E8:2C:XX:XX:XX`   | `192.168.50.38`    | —              |
| Raspberry Pi   | `2C:67:6B:XX:XX:XX`   | `192.168.50.100`   | `Raspberry_Pi` |
| PVR_Notebook   | `8C:F8:C5:XX:XX:XX`   | `192.168.50.117`   | —              |

> These IPs are reserved directly in the **ASUS RT-AX86U Pro** router’s DHCP static assignment table to ensure consistency across reboots and firmware updates.

This strategy supports a more **deterministic, auditable, and manageable** home lab environment — particularly important for maintaining service availability and accurate logging in a network defense context.

### 📡 Advanced Wireless Channel Planning

To optimize wireless stability and device compatibility:

- **Channel 40** manually assigned to the `STARLINK SECURE_AP` 5 GHz guest network broadcast by the **XT9 in AP mode**, ensuring Roku TV compatibility with lower 5 GHz channels.
- **Channel 161** assigned to `Sky Home Net_5G` on the **RT-AX86U Pro** to avoid co-channel interference.
- 2.4 GHz channel fixed to **channel 11** to reduce congestion from overlapping neighboring networks.
- Manual channel planning eliminates DFS-related issues and ensures non-interfering channel reuse between the RT-AX and XT9 AP.

> Unified SSIDs with distinct manual channels on each AP improve roaming behavior and overall RF efficiency in dense environments.
