---

### üåê DNSSEC & Encrypted DNS Configuration

The RT-AX86U Pro router is hardened with **DNSSEC validation** and **DNS-over-TLS (DoT)** to protect DNS integrity and privacy across the home lab:

| Setting                        | Value                         |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **DNS Privacy Protocol**       | DNS-over-TLS (DoT)            |
| **Profile**                    | Strict (no fallback allowed)  |
| **Primary Resolver**           | Quad9 (`9.9.9.9`, `dns.quad9.net`) |
| **Secondary Resolver**         | Cloudflare (`1.1.1.1`, `cloudflare-dns.com`) |
| **Enable DNSSEC Support**      | ‚úÖ Yes                        |
| **Validate Unsigned Replies**  | ‚úÖ Yes (rejects bogus responses) |
| **Prevent Client Auto DoH**    | ‚úÖ Yes (forces router-controlled DNS) |
| **DNS Rebind Protection**      | ‚úÖ Enabled                    |

> This configuration ensures all DNS lookups are both **encrypted in transit** and **cryptographically validated** at the router level. Quad9 provides additional security filtering for malicious domains, while Cloudflare acts as a resilient fallback. Clients cannot bypass DNS policy using DoH, guaranteeing consistent enforcement across the network.

### üì° ISP Redundancy and Bypass Configuration

| Component               | Role                                                    |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Starlink Ethernet Adapter** | Primary uplink via Starlink satellite ‚Äî Bypass Mode ‚úÖ  |
| **Smartphone (5G)**    | Dedicated cellular uplink for ISP failover              |
| **Speedify App**       | Channel-bonds cellular + Starlink for seamless failover |
| **Wi-Fi Repeater**     | Bridges phone connection into the local network         |
| **USB Hub**            | Bus-powered hub ensures stable power to repeater & phone|

> **Bypass Mode:** The Starlink router is placed in bypass mode using the official **Ethernet Adapter**, allowing the RT-AX86U Pro to act as the sole DHCP/NAT/firewall authority. Cellular traffic is managed by Speedify for redundancy.

---

## üìå Static IP Addressing Strategy
To maintain consistency, reduce DHCP churn, and simplify device identification in log files and firewall rules, key infrastructure devices are assigned **static IP addresses** through the router‚Äôs DHCP reservation table.

### üéØ Why Static IPs?

Static IP assignments serve several important functions in a secure and segmented home lab:

- **Reliability**: Devices like the syslog server (Raspberry Pi) or VPN-routed desktops maintain the same address, ensuring uninterrupted forwarding, monitoring, and access.
- **Log Integrity**: Centralized logging systems benefit from stable IPs, making it easier to trace events and correlate activity in Kibana dashboards.
- **Firewall Control**: Granular UFW and router-level firewall rules depend on consistent IPs to restrict access (e.g., only allow Logstash ports from `192.168.50.3`).
- **DNS and Hostname Mapping**: Enables optional hostname assignments for clarity across logs and tools.
- **Reduced Conflict**: Prevents accidental DHCP assignment overlap or reassignment that could break scripts, SSH tunnels, or static routes.

### üß≠ Static IP Map

| Device         | MAC Address          | Static IP         | Hostname       |
|----------------|----------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| Peters_Desktop | `D8:43:AE:XX:XX:XX`   | `192.168.50.3`     | ‚Äî              |
| HP Office Jet  | `80:E8:2C:XX:XX:XX`   | `192.168.50.38`    | ‚Äî              |
| Raspberry Pi   | `2C:67:6B:XX:XX:XX`   | `192.168.50.100`   | `Raspberry_Pi` |
| PVR_Notebook   | `8C:F8:C5:XX:XX:XX`   | `192.168.50.117`   | ‚Äî              |

> These IPs are reserved directly in the **ASUS RT-AX86U Pro** router‚Äôs DHCP static assignment table to ensure consistency across reboots and firmware updates.

This strategy supports a more **deterministic, auditable, and manageable** home lab environment ‚Äî particularly important for maintaining service availability and accurate logging in a network defense context.

### üì° Advanced Wireless Channel Planning

To optimize wireless stability and device compatibility:

- **Channel 40** manually assigned to the 5 GHz guest network ensuring Roku TV compatibility with lower 5 GHz channels.
- **Channel 161** assigned to secure 5 GHz to avoid co-channel interference.
- 2.4 GHz channel fixed to **channel 11** to reduce congestion from overlapping neighboring networks.
- Manual channel planning eliminates DFS-related issues and ensures non-interfering channel reuse.
