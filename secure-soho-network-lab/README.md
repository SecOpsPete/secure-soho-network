## üõ°Ô∏è Home Network Security Lab

This lab showcases the design and implementation of a resilient, secure, and segmented home network environment, engineered for hands-on cybersecurity experimentation and IT networking experience. The architecture is anchored by the ASUS RT-AX86U Pro router, complemented by an ASUS ZenWiFi XT9 AX7800 mesh node operating in Access Point (AP) mode. This dual-device configuration provides robust wireless coverage, high-throughput bandwidth, and optimized channel separation tailored for performance, compatibility, and interference reduction across a variety of devices.

Key components of the network include:

- **Segmented Network Topology**: Implements logical separation of trusted devices, IoT endpoints, and guest clients through SSID isolation and VLAN-like segmentation strategies, reducing lateral movement risk in the event of compromise.
  
- **Advanced Wireless Configuration**: Channels are manually assigned and fine-tuned across 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands to minimize congestion and interference, with specific accommodations made for device compatibility (e.g., Roku channel preference).

- **VPN Fusion with NordVPN**: Enables dynamic split tunneling, allowing designated devices to route traffic through secure NordVPN connections while others use direct ISP access, balancing privacy needs with speed and functionality.

- **Firewall Hardening**: The ASUS router firewall settings are manually configured to block unsolicited inbound traffic and prevent common attack vectors, supplemented by additional endpoint protections and UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) rules on the Raspberry Pi.

- **Centralized Syslog Logging**: A dedicated Raspberry Pi 4 device serves as the centralized syslog server, ingesting and parsing logs from network and system devices. It integrates with the ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack and provides rich visibility into system activity, connection attempts, and potential anomalies.

- **Power Redundancy and Protection**: The entire network infrastructure is safeguarded by a **CyberPower CP1500PFCLCD PFC Sinewave UPS System** (1500VA/1000W), which ensures uninterrupted power delivery during outages and voltage fluctuations. This system includes Automatic Voltage Regulation (AVR), protecting sensitive electronics and preserving uptime during brief brownouts or surges.

- **Scalable Monitoring Capabilities**: The syslog architecture supports ongoing expansion with Filebeat for Elastic Common Schema (ECS) compliance, allowing deeper event correlation, future SIEM integrations, and enhanced alerting capabilities.

- **Resiliency & Redundancy**: Multiple layers of redundancy are being built into the system, including hardware failover capabilities, segmented wireless access, independent logging pipelines, and modular, containerized services. These enhancements support long-term scalability and reliability for lab scenarios simulating enterprise-level security postures.

This evolving lab reflects a practical, real-world approach to network defense-in-depth and operational resilience. It serves as a foundational platform for ongoing experiments in endpoint hardening, event logging, detection engineering, and secure remote connectivity ‚Äî all within a controlled and observable home environment.

## üîß Router Configuration Summary

### ‚úîÔ∏è Wireless Settings

| Band | SSID | Security | Bandwidth | Features |
|------|------|----------|-----------|----------|
| 2.4GHz | SecOpsPete_Main | WPA2-Personal / AES | 20/40 MHz | Wi-Fi 6, PMF Capable, Agile Multiband |
| 5GHz | SecOpsPete_Main | WPA2-Personal / AES | 80 MHz | Wi-Fi 6, TWT, Agile Multiband |
| Guest (2.4GHz) | Old IoT SSID | WPA2-Personal / AES | 20 MHz | Intranet Access Disabled, Device Isolation Enabled |

> The ASUS ZenWiFi XT9 AX7800 is configured as a dedicated Access Point (AP), extending Wi-Fi coverage while maintaining a unified SSID structure and inheriting all security policies from the RT-AX86U Pro core router.

---

### üì° Advanced Wireless Channel Planning

To optimize wireless stability and device compatibility:

- **Channel 40** manually assigned to the `STARLINK SECURE_AP` 5 GHz guest network broadcast by the **XT9 in AP mode**, ensuring Roku TV compatibility with lower 5 GHz channels.
- **Channel 161** assigned to `Sky Home Net_5G` on the **RT-AX86U Pro** to avoid co-channel interference.
- 2.4 GHz channel fixed to **channel 11** to reduce congestion from overlapping neighboring networks.
- Manual channel planning eliminates DFS-related issues and ensures non-interfering channel reuse between the RT-AX and XT9 AP.

> Unified SSIDs with distinct manual channels on each AP improve roaming behavior and overall RF efficiency in dense environments.
